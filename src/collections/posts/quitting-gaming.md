I quit gaming recently. I was thinking about my life and the person I want to be, and how I can make future me proud of today me. After a lot of thoughtful consideration and avoidance, I couldn't run from it anymore. I had to quit if I wanted to get anywhere in life on purpose. I don't know future Amaris all that well, so this might be more of a gaming sabbatical than a divorce. But for now, here are my thoughts on it and why I've been a bit shocked at the responses I get. 

Playing video games just doesn't further me or my dreams, it doesn't nourish my soul or leave me feeling rested or ready for anything else in life.
